OutsiderTools

A set of tools to assist in playing DnD4 online. 

Why?
--
I deciced to create the project because I want to combine two hobbies. Roleplaying in Dnd4 and Hacking Scala. 

This project is at the moment mainly for storing my scala hacking related to dnd4 in one place. 

Character Visualizer
--
The first tool. Convert a dnd4e xml file into a textual representation. 

Example on how to run:
mvn scala:run "-DaddArgs<file>.dnd4e" -> print out the character in the mvn output
mvn scala:run "-DaddArgs<file>.dnd4e|file.txt" -> print out the character in the file.txt file

This visualizer feature will be part of the web site when it is created.
